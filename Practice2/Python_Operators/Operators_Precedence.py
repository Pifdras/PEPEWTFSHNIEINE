#Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

#Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

#Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefore multiplications are evaluated before additions:

print(100 + 5 * 3)

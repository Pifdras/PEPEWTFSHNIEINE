# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

# Operator     Name                               Example
# ==           Equal                              x == y
# !=           Not Equal                          x != y
# >            Greater than                       x > y
# <            Less than                          x < y
# >=           Greater than or equal to           x >= y
# <=           Less than or equal to              x <= y

x = 5
y = 3

print(x == y)
print(x != y)
print(x > y)
print(x < y)
print(x >= y)
print(x <= y)

# Python allows you to chain comparison operators:

x = 5

print(1 < x < 10)

print(1 < x and x < 10)
